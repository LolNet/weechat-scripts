xclipurl
========

This script will collect URL in a buffer and then present you with a prompt
to select the URL (with Up/Down arrow key). Once you pressed Enter,
the selected URL will be put into the clipboard. Pressing Ctrl-C will cancel
the URL selection. This script requires [xclip][].

[xclip]: http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/

To be able to see the prompt and the selected URL, you must first add item
`xclipurl` into a bar. You might also want to bind a key for command `/xclipurl`.
