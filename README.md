These are a few Lua scripts I wrote for [Weechat][].

- **mpdbitl** is the 'Now Playing' status for [bitlbee][] + [mpd][]

- **urlselect** is for interactively select URLs in a buffer and then store it
  into X clipboard or [tmux][] paste buffer.

- **tagattr** is for adding labels and apply custom color to messages with
  certain tags.

- **mpd_current_song** is bar item for displaying currently playing song on MPD.

- **typeass** is not important. Just ignore it.
