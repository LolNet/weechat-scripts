These are a few Lua scripts I wrote for [Weechat][].

- **pastebuf** is for viewing the content of a pastebin URL.

- **urlselect** is for interactively select URLs in a buffer using a bar.

- **chatbuf_color** is for colorizing all lines in a buffer with the same color.
  Useful for merged buffers.

- **mpdbitl** is the 'Now Playing' status for [bitlbee][] + [mpd][]

- **coldlist** is half-assed hotlist-like notification for merged buffers.

- **tagattr** is for adding labels and apply custom color to messages with
  certain tags. **This is obsolete since Weechat 0.4.4**. A trigger can do its
  job better.

- **mpd_current_song** is bar item for displaying currently playing song on MPD.
  **This is obsolete too since Weechat 0.4.4**. You can do similar thing with a
  timer trigger combined with script text_item.py

- **typeass** is not important. Just ignore it.
